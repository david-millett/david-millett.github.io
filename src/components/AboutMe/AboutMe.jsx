                {/* <p>With a decade of experience in journalism, communications, and digital publishing - in both medical and design fields - I have always been drawn to roles that combine logic and creativity. It was in my free time, spent building intricate spreadsheets - from automating progressive workout routines to analysing data on the books I had read - that I realised I was trying to code without the best tools. Discovering the possibilities provided by coding languages struck me like a bolt of lightning, and I soon enrolled on a software engineering course at General Assembly. I thrive on creating results and solutions, learning new things, and understanding complex concepts, which is why I am excited to bring my experience and designerâ€™s eye to a career in this field.</p> */}
